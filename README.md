This is final project for OSS class

My project operate Ping_Pong game on raspberry pi

The header file <coino.h> was not available in the Linux environment, so it implemented the direct console funtionally.

# What does this project do?
This project is a ping pong game implemented using C++

This game takes a console input/output based approach on displaying objects and controlling the game.

# Why is this project useful?
The reason why this project is useful is that you can study keystroke functions that can replace header file functions that are only available in Windows environments. The game starts when the rubber key is entered.
